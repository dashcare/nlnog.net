At our regular NLNOG meetings we often don’t have enough time for proper deep dives or active workshops into various network topics – but no more! So, if you ever wanted to give a hands on splicing workshop, tell us about your latest open source contribution, network automation, deliver a hands-on BGP how-to, show your home automation setup, talk about your IETF draft, pitch an idea, anything is possible!

The NLNOG Camp will take place from June 1st to June 3rd 2018 on [Scoutinglandgoed Zeewolde, Netherlands](https://scoutinglandgoed.scouting.nl/).

# The Plan

Arrive on Friday afternoon, set up your tent if you’ll be staying to camp with us, enjoy a beverage and meet other folks. On Saturday there is room to present ideas, attend or give workshops, demonstrate cool stuff or just hang around. Saturday evening we’ll wrap up the day with a festive BBQ. On Sunday there is no program other than packing up your camping gear and going back home!

# Registration

Registration must be done [HERE](https://ti.to/nlnog/nlnog-camp-2018). The participation fee is 50 euro, but you can pay more if you want. There is a limited number of tickets available! If the tickets are sold out – make sure you sign up for the waiting list!

## Call for Content

If you want to organise a workshop, present something, or give a lecture, please reach out to events@nlnog.net !

## But I don’t like camping?

Then pick one of the hotels close by! You can attend the workshops, lectures & BBQ without sleeping on the camping site. We’ll have three very large tents for all activities and a plan B should it be raining.
