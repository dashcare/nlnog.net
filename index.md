## Featured project: [NLNOG RING](https://ring.nlnog.net/)

A point of view outside your network is absolutely essential, seeing what others see is a useful thing with a variety of network problems. The RING provides a 'shell access' exchange between all participants to make it easier to debug network issues and troubleshoot 'from the outside'.
