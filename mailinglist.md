The Mailman server for NLNOG at [http://mailman.nlnog.net](http://mailman.nlnog.net/) hosts the NLNOG@nlnog.net mailing list and its [archives](http://mailman.nlnog.net/pipermail/nlnog/). Roughly 400 participants from the Dutch Internet community are subscribed to this list.

# The NLNOG mailing list

The NLNOG list is open to anyone, but the main language is Dutch, but if you are not fluent in this terrestrial variation on Klingonese, feel free to post in English.
